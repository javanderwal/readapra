The R package `readapra` provides a series of function to download and import data from the [Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA)](https://www.apra.gov.au/) statistical publications and return them as a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) object.

## Installation

You can install `readapra` from CRAN using:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readapra")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub using the [`remotes`](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("javanderwal/readapra")
```

## Features

The `readapra` package facilitates the downloading and importing of statistical publications published by APRA. The package also allows for the importing of data from locally saved statistical publication files.

Currently the `readapra` package only supports the downloading and importing of Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) statistical publications. The intention is for future versions of `readapra` to also accommodate APRA's general insurance, life insurance and friendly societies, private health insurance and superannuation statistical publications. 

#### ADI statistical publications

The following ADI statistical publications can be downloaded and imported with `readapra`:

-   [Quarterly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Performance Statistics (QADIPS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/quarterly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics)

-   [Quarterly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Centralised Publication (QADICP)](https://www.apra.gov.au/quarterly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics)

-   [Quarterly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Property Exposures Statistics (QADIPEXS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/quarterly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics) (both the current and historic series)

-   [Monthly Authorised Deposit- taking Institution Statistics (MADIS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/monthly-authorised-deposit-taking-institution-statistics) (both the current and historic series)

-   [Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Points of Presence Statistics (ADIPOPS)](https://www.apra.gov.au/authorised-deposit-taking-institutions-points-of-presence-statistics)

## Example

The ability to download and import APRA's statistical publications with `readapra` greatly eases the analysis and visualisation of this data via packages such as `ggplot2`.

The following example demonstrates the plotting of total resident assets on a monthly basis for Australia's four major banks. 

We start by first librarying the required packages:

```{r library_packages, message = FALSE}
library(readapra)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

We then download and import the Monthly Authorised Deposit-taking Institution Statistics (MADIS) data using the `read_madis()` function:

```{r get_madis}
madis_data <- read_madis("current")
```

We then filter the desired data like so:

```{r clean_madis}
major_bank_assets <-
  madis_data %>%
  filter(
    abn %in% c(48123123124, 33007457141, 12004044937, 11005357522),
    series == "Total residents assets"
  )
```

And then finally we can plot the data using `ggplot2`:

```{r plot_madis, dpi=300, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(
  data = major_bank_assets,
  mapping = aes(date, value, colour = institution_name)
) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(ncol = 1))
```

## Managing Network Connections

Corporate networks, especially those using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), may restrict the ability to download files within an R session. A possible fix for this is to utilise the the `"wininet"` method for downloading files. Users can specify the `"wininet"` method (or any other download method) for `readapra` to use by setting the `"R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD"` environment variable. 

To set the `"R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD"` environment variable to `"wininet"` for your current session, use the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv("R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD" = "wininet")
```

You can add `"R_READAPRA_DL_METHOD" = "wininet"` to your `.Renviron` file to ensure this download setting persists across R sessions. You can conveniently access and edit your `.Renviron` file with the [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
